        The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. 
        It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. 
        Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".
        The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
        Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. 
        Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

        The use of this data set in cluster analysis however is uncommon, since the data set only contains two clusters with rather obvious separation. 
        One of the clusters contains Iris setosa, while the other cluster contains both Iris virginica and Iris versicolor and is not separable without the species information Fisher used. 
        This makes the data set a good example to explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised techniques in data mining: 
        Fisher's linear discriminant model can only be obtained when the object species are known: class labels and clusters are not necessarily the same
